# Clustering - Customer Segmentation

Using different clustering methods to group customers of a telecommunications company, to see if customers that churn more often can be characterized as one group. Using Silhouette score to compare the performance of different clustering methods. Including client presentation.

The models includes the use of:

* PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
* KMeans, DBSCAN

and the following libraries:

* SKLearn (Clustering)
* Seaborn (Visualization)
* PyMySQL (Datapull)

We identified 4 groups of customers, where one of them had a **churn rate about twice as high as the average**.
